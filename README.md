## Blockchain

Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. 

The aim of this project is to create a basic 'blockchain' in Java and implement a simple proof of work (mining) system.
